<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do so in the future.</p>


<p class="blueText col-xs-12"><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></p>


<p class="innerText col-xs-12">CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&#39;s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">Users can visit our site anonymously</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &#39;Privacy&#39;, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> On our Privacy Policy Page</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">Users are able to change their personal information:</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> By emailing us</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> By chatting with us or sending us a ticket</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">It&#39;s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>


<p class="blueText col-xs-12"><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>


<p class="innerText col-xs-12">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation&#39;s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s privacy and safety online.
</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We market to and collect information from children under 13.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We also allow third parties, including ad networks, or plug-ins collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>In order to remove your child&#39;s information please contact the following personnel: </strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">Aleksandar Toplek</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">aleksandar.toplek@sparkiy.com</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>We adhere to the following COPPA tenants: </strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> We will not require a child to disclose more infomration than is reasonably necessary to particapate in an activity.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Parents can review their child&#39;s personal information, direct us to delete it, and refuse to allow any further collection or use of the child&#39;s information.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Parents can agree to the collection and use of their child&#39;s information, but still NOT allow disclosure to third parties unless that&#39;s part of the service.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Parents can review, delete, manage or refuse with whom their child&#39;s information is shared through through emailing our support staff, through calling our support number, by mailing us a letter contacting us directly.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> We will notify parents directly before collecting PII from their kids. This includes what specific information you will want to collect and how it might be disclosed, a link to your online privacy policy, and how the parents can give their consent. Also, if the parent doesn&#39;t consent within a reasonable time you will delete the parent&#39;s and childs online contact info from your records.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Parents can give consent by sign a consent form and send it back to you via fax, mail, or electronic scan, use a credit card, debit card, or other online payment system that provides notification of each separate transaction to the account holder, provide a copy of a form of government issued ID that you check against a database, as long as you delete the identification from your records when you finish the verification process or contacting us directly.</p>


<p class="blueText col-xs-12"><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>


<p class="innerText col-xs-12">The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We will notify the users via email</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Within 7 business days</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">We will notify the users via in site notification</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Within 7 business days</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>


<p class="blueText col-xs-12"><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>


<p class="innerText col-xs-12">The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12">
<strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</strong></p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</p>

<p class="innerText col-xs-12"> <strong>&bull;</strong> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</p>
